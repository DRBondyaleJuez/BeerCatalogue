## __DESCRIPTION__
This code was used as a training exercise to practice coding in java, postgreSQL and spring.

To develop this simple service this code uses [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). It has only 3 endpoints 1 get and 2 posts.
The persistence uses relational database storage based on [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). The relational database stored the beer, manufacturer and access control information.

The service allows any client to retrieve information about the beers and manufacturer provided by the service.
It first consults the information present in the database and in the case of beers it also consults another API for information
if it is absent from the database and then returns the information demanded if possible.

Clients can also create a user profile associated with a particular manufacturer. Then this user after signing in they can 
add or modify beer or manufacturer information associated with the manufacturer their profile has authorization to edit.

There is also an admin profile which is able to perform any operation on any entry in the database after signing in.
